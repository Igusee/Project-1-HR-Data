# HR data Project 

The data and idea for this project were inspired by a video from the YouTube channel Her Data Project.

## About my data: 
* Over 20K distinct records of employees in .csv format
* Simple HR data, without any financial informations
* Mostly properly formatted, with a few exceptions in data fields

## MySQL Query
* Created database
* Loaded records from .csv file using built in tool in MySQL Workbench
* Cleaned columns with incorrect data formats using CASE command
* Fixed some issues generated by cleanup using CASE and DATE_SUB
* Changed data types where necessary
* Added calculated column with age of employee based on birthdates
* Connected database to PowerBI
* The .sql file is in this repo - feel free to check it out :)

## PowerBI 
* After loading data I reviewed data types once again
* Ensured that all date columns loaded properly
* Since Power Query tasks were handled in MySQL, I proceeded directly to analysing the data
* Created calculated columns and measures using DAX
* Created Visuals based on my newly created columns
* Formatted my dashboards to my preferences
* The .pbix file as well as PDF dashboards are also attached in this repo! 

## This is the end of this project, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did!
